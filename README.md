### THIS IS A STAND-ALONE MOD!!! DO NOT USE ANY OTHER MODS WITH
### THIS ONE, BECAUSE THEY WILL CAUSE THIS MOD TO WORK INCORRECTLY...
### THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THIS MOD AFFECTS:
### LOOT POOLS/DROP RATES, ENEMY HEALTH/DAMAGE SCALING,
### PLAYER HEALTH/DAMAGE SCALING, VARIOUS PASSIVES ON GEAR,
### INTERACTIVE OBJECTS, PLAYER/ENEMY PHYSICS SCALES, ETC...
### ALSO, THIS MOD IS FOR ARMS RACE ONLY DUE TO CUSTOM SCALING
### TO COMPENSATE FOR LACK OF ACTION SKILLS AND GUARDIAN RANK PERKS...
### BALANCING WILL BE OFF IF USED ON ANY MAP BESIDES ARMS RACE!!!
### This mod is designed for VETERAN players that are looking for a fun challenge ;) 
###
### This combination of numerous edited mods FINALLY makes Arms Race an absolute blast to play.
### Massive thanx to ALL original modders for all of their hard work on the initial mods that I combined,
### tested, and completely reworked to make this version where I'm trying to keep everything properly balanced.
### My inspirantion for this mod was the Boss Race mod by SkruntSkrunt which I thought was an excellent
### concept, but it did not feel balanced to me and running thru it with friends gave me numerous ideas, so
### I started looking over all available hotfixes and set out on a 11 months long jouney to create this mod.
### The timers are extended to a total playtime of around 160 minutes per run plus killing the final bosses.
### All spawns have been modified to be replaced with mini-bosses and bosses from the main game and
### all the DLC's, plus the Cartel's Event, Wotan and some of the Trial bosses too. Skags/spiderants have been
### replaced with dinos/boss spiderants. Massive chubbies have been added. Heavyweight Harker now
### spawns in the Hag of Fervor, One-punch and Voltborn during the final boss battle with him.
### 190 weapons (including the Eridian Fabricator) have been custom balanced for this mode,
### along with various overall weapon improvemts, including a faster reload time on all weapons
### 20 grenades have been custom balanced for this mode, along with various overall grenade improvements
### 6 shields have been customized, including an extensive re-work of the rough rider shield
### 3 artifacts have been customized, including an extensive re-work of the Pearl of Knowledge
### various buffs to passives on class mods and on artifacts, including some fixes
### the addition of the unreleased class mod for zane that drop on the arms race map
### Player/enemy health/damage has all been customized, including enemy resizing and display name
### corrections, and swapping weapons that some enemies have equipped (including Harker)
### various changes to ammo chests/pickups, vending machine changes that now include the Arms Race map
### custom loot pools assigned to various enemies and the eridian fabricator
### various fixes to descriptions on weapons, shields, and artifacts
### removed all anointments that are useless in arms race, with exception of action skill end
### splash damage anoint because some weapons spawned with no anointment if that one
### was not in the anointment pool. not sure why this was the case, however any anointments
### that are action skill start/end dependant have been removed since you can't proc them
### included various UI/QoL fixes to keep things nice and clean, including red text explainer,
### removing xp bar, improved photo mode, no loyalty reward notifications, etc.
### various changes to enemy/player movement mechanics and enemy weapon stats
### increased ammo carry count, unlimited backpack and bank capacity expanded to 9999
### increased xp gains to enable a lvl 13 starter run to reach lvl 72 before end of run
### added the ability to use arms race gear during the run on the arms race map
### Customized the map and fast travel station to include name of mod and new description
### fixed some weapons/gear to be able to drop with an anointment since they now drop on this map
### increased player base health, increased player base melee damage (including ability to crit on melee)
### removed heavy weapon penality and player self-splash damage (except of backburner baby projectiles)
### non-elemental damage is now more balanced, with enhancements to elemental DoT damage
### enabling Cartel Event enemies to spawn in the arms race map (works about 10% of the time)
### the addition of "classic" loot beams that replicate the look of loot in borderlands 2
### better loot odds from area challenge chests and final extract station expanded to send more items
### This is designed to be playable solo or with friends (co-op is HIGHLY recommended)
### WHEN STARTING A RUN, it is HIGHLY recommended to start with some "starter" gear using
### the VAULT CARDS: The Super Soldier shield, Pyroburst grenade, Overclocked Troubleshooter, and
### a Shlooter artifact (specifically with a HEALTH REGEN roll on it, due to damage taken during run)
###
### There are a few things that affect the HOST ONLY and do NOT carry over to guests
### the "unlimited" bank does NOT carry over
### the final extract station being expanded does NOT carry over
### any name changes, character resizing, UI changes does NOT carry over
### weapon/gear changes are NOT visible to guests when gear is laying on the ground
### HOWEVER, guests DO see the changes once they pick an item up (euipped or in their backpack)
### console-players CAN join this mod and play, BUT OLD-GEN consoles will CRASH after 60-90 minutes
### IF the loot is NOT picked up and just left on the map. OLD-GEN consoles will also CRASH
### IF there is more than about 150-180 items in the backpack, so stuff needs to be sold during run.
### 60% of my testers were on console, with half of them being on OLD-GEN console, so this has been
### extensively tested and I feel that this is a good warning for people of possible crashes and how to avoid them.
###
### 
###
### ADDITIONAL THANX TO ALL OF MY ALPHA, BETA, AND PRE-RELEASE TESTERS THAT GAVE THEIR TIME
### AND HELPED WITH NUMEROUS SUGGESTIONS FOR SPAWNS AND CORRESPONDING DEDICATED GEAR TO MAKE
### THIS A FUN, CHALLENGING, AND REWARDING EXPERIENCE FOR ANY PLAYER REGARDLESS OF PLAYSTYLE.
### WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TESTING NUMEROUS ENEMIES, INCLUDING ONES THAT DIDN'T MAKE 
### THE FINAL CUT DUE TO BROKEN MOVING MECHANICS, BROKEN IMMUNITY PHASES AND VARIOUS
### OTHER BUGS AND GLITCHES... I AM GRATEFUL FOR Y'ALLS PATIENCE THROUGH ALL CRASHES,
### FROZEN GAME SESSIONS AND ALL THE TIMES Y'ALL HAD TO WATCH CLAPTRAP DANCE YET AGAIN ;P
### 
### In no particular order, some of the ones (not everyone wanted to be named) that contributed to testing were:
### mojejaja69, belphagor1234, razor-dtr, Ms_Ducky, vovip77, body-snatcher, cor319ey, about25schmeckls, 
### FxR_MONSTER, MzSkittlez, Kuudere, un1c0rn_gal, sphericbones, evilempire2000, and brokenwings99...
###
### as of 09242023, the mod is COMPLETE!!! I am very happy with the result and now just need to clean-up the code
### before I feel comfortable releasing this.... but still, after eleven long fucking months of development, with me 
### starting on this last Halloween, this thing is finally what I wanted in my mind when I first started... YAY!
