##### THIS IS A STAND-ALONE MOD!!! DO NOT USE ANY OTHER MODS WITH
##### THIS ONE, BECAUSE THEY WILL CAUSE THIS MOD TO WORK INCORRECTLY...
##### THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THIS MOD AFFECTS:
##### LOOT POOLS/DROP RATES, ENEMY HEALTH/DAMAGE SCALING,
##### PLAYER HEALTH/DAMAGE SCALING, VARIOUS PASSIVES ON GEAR,
##### INTERACTIVE OBJECTS, PLAYER/ENEMY PHYSICS SCALES, ETC...
##### ALSO, THIS MOD IS FOR ARMS RACE ONLY DUE TO CUSTOM SCALING
##### TO COMPENSATE FOR LACK OF ACTION SKILLS AND GUARDIAN RANK PERKS...
##### BALANCING WILL BE OFF IF USED ON ANY MAP BESIDES ARMS RACE!!!
##### This mod is designed for VETERAN players that are looking for a fun challenge ;) 
#####
#####
#####
##### This combination of numerous edited mods FINALLY makes Arms Race an absolute blast to play.
##### Massive thanx to ALL original modders for all of their hard work on the initial mods that I combined,
##### tested, and completely reworked to make this version where I'm trying to keep everything properly balanced.
##### My inspiration for this mod was the Boss Race mod by SkruntSkrunt which I thought was an excellent
##### concept, but it did not feel balanced to me and running thru it with friends gave me numerous ideas, so
##### I started looking over all available hotfixes and set out on a 11 month-long journey to create this mod.
##### - The timers are extended to a total playtime of around 160 minutes per run, plus killing the final bosses.
##### - All spawns have been modified to be replaced with mini-bosses and bosses from the main game and
##### all the DLC's, plus the Cartel's Event, Wotan and some of the Trial bosses too. Skags/spiderants have been
##### replaced with dinos/boss spiderants. Massive chubbies have been added. Heavyweight Harker now
##### spawns in the Hag of Fervor, One-punch and Voltborn during the final boss battle with him.
##### - 190 weapons (including the Eridian Fabricator) have been custom balanced for this mode,
##### along with various overall weapon improvements, including a faster reload time on all weapons
##### - 20 grenades have been custom balanced for this mode, along with various overall grenade improvements
##### - 6 shields have been customized, including an extensive re-work of the rough rider shield
##### - 3 artifacts have been customized, including an extensive re-work of the Pearl of Knowledge
##### - various buffs to passives on class mods and on artifacts, including some fixes
##### - the addition of the unreleased class mod for Zane that drops on the arms race map
##### - Player/enemy health/damage has all been customized, including enemy resizing and display name
##### corrections, and swapping weapons that some enemies have equipped (including Harker)
##### - various changes to ammo chests/pickups, vending machine changes that now include the Arms Race map
##### - custom loot pools assigned to various enemies and a custom loot pool for the eridian fabricator
##### - various fixes to descriptions on weapons, shields, and artifacts
##### - removed all anointments that are useless in arms race, with exception of action skill end
##### splash damage anoint because some weapons spawned with no anointment if that one
##### was not in the anointment pool. not sure why this was the case, however any anointments
##### that are action skill start/end dependent have been removed since you can't proc them in Arms Race
##### - included various UI/QoL fixes to keep things nice and clean, including red text explainer,
##### removing xp bar, improved photo mode, no loyalty reward notifications, etc.
##### - various changes to enemy/player movement mechanics and enemy weapon stats
##### - increased ammo carry count, unlimited backpack and bank capacity expanded to 9999
##### - increased xp gains to enable a lvl 13 starter run to reach lvl 72 before end of run
##### - added the ability to use arms race gear during the run on the arms race map
##### - Customized the map and fast travel station to include name of mod and new description
##### - fixed some weapons/gear to be able to drop with an anointment since they now drop on this map
##### - increased player base health, increased player base melee damage (including ability to crit on melee)
##### - removed heavy weapon penalty and player self-splash damage (except Backburner child projectiles)
##### - non-elemental damage is now more balanced, with enhancements to elemental DoT damage
##### - enabling Cartel Event enemies to spawn in the arms race map (works about 10% of the time)
##### - the addition of "classic" loot beams that replicate the look of loot in borderlands 2
##### - better loot odds from area challenge chests and final extract station expanded to send more items
##### - FFYL Time extended from default 12 seconds to 45 seconds to compensate for no guardian rank perks 
##### This is designed to be playable solo or with friends (co-op is HIGHLY recommended)
##### WHEN STARTING A RUN, it is HIGHLY recommended to start with some "starter" gear using
##### the VAULT CARDS: The Super Soldier shield, Pyroburst grenade, Overclocked Troubleshooter, and
##### a Shlooter artifact (specifically with a HEALTH REGEN roll on it, due to damage taken during run)
#####
#####
#####
##### This is designed to be played with a level 72 character on Mayhem 10/11, however is also a LOT of fun
##### if played by host with a modded character that is at level 13, but has mayhem unlocked...
#####
#####
#####
##### There are a few things that affect the HOST ONLY and do NOT carry over to guests:
##### - the "unlimited" bank does NOT carry over
##### - the final extract station being expanded does NOT carry over
##### - any name changes, character resizing, UI changes does NOT carry over
##### - weapon/gear changes are NOT visible to guests when gear is laying on the ground
##### HOWEVER, guests DO see the changes once they pick an item up (equipped or in their backpack)
##### console-players CAN join this mod and play, BUT OLD-GEN consoles will CRASH after 60-90 minutes
##### IF the loot is NOT picked up and just left on the map. OLD-GEN consoles will also CRASH
##### IF there is more than about 150-180 items in the backpack, so stuff needs to be sold during run.
##### 60% of my testers were on console, with half of them being on OLD-GEN console, so this has been
##### extensively tested and I feel that this is a good warning for people of possible crashes and how to avoid them.
#####
##### 
#####
##### ADDITIONAL THANX TO ALL OF MY ALPHA, BETA, AND PRE-RELEASE TESTERS THAT GAVE THEIR TIME
##### AND HELPED WITH NUMEROUS SUGGESTIONS FOR SPAWNS AND CORRESPONDING DEDICATED GEAR TO MAKE
##### THIS A FUN, CHALLENGING, AND REWARDING EXPERIENCE FOR ANY PLAYER REGARDLESS OF PLAYSTYLE.
##### WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TESTING NUMEROUS ENEMIES, INCLUDING ONES THAT DIDN'T MAKE 
##### THE FINAL CUT DUE TO BROKEN MOVING MECHANICS, BROKEN IMMUNITY PHASES AND VARIOUS
##### OTHER BUGS AND GLITCHES... I AM GRATEFUL FOR Y'ALLS PATIENCE THROUGH ALL CRASHES,
##### FROZEN GAME SESSIONS AND ALL THE TIMES Y'ALL HAD TO WATCH CLAPTRAP DANCE YET AGAIN ;P
##### 
##### In no particular order, some of the ones (not everyone wanted to be named) that contributed to testing were:
##### mojejaja69, belphagor1234, razor-dtr, Ms_Ducky, vovip77, body-snatcher, cor319ey, about25schmeckls, 
##### FxR_MONSTER, MzSkittlez, Kuudere, un1c0rn_gal, sphericbones, evilempire2000, and brokenwings99...
#####
#####
#####
##### as of 09242023, the mod is COMPLETE!!! I am very happy with the result and now just need to clean-up the code
##### before I feel comfortable releasing this.... but still, after eleven long fucking months of development, with me 
##### starting on this last Halloween, this thing is finally close to what I wanted in my mind when I first started... YAY!
#####
#####
#####
##### The following are KNOWN issues that may occur during a run, which I have NOT been able to fix:
#####
##### - occasionally The Sky Bully enemy will spawn on top of a structure/building and will just sit there idly.
##### Due to changed player movement mechanics, in some instances, you can still reach him to initiate
##### the battle, but in some cases this is not possible. Homing grenades can be used to kill them, but the loot
##### can't always be reached. While this can be a little annoying sometimes, it never breaks anything if you 
##### can't kill him since he doesn't spawn in places where this would end up being a progression blocker.
##### 
##### - occasionally, when Wotan splits into his "Upper-half" and "Lower-Half" during a battle, if it's in a tunnel
##### his "Upper-half" or "Lower-half" can glitch under the floor or above the ceiling where that part can not be
##### killed. This never occurs anywhere where it would end up being a progression blocker. If you are fighting
##### him in some of the buildings, occasionally when Wotan splits, his "Upper-half" will end glitching onto the
##### roof of the building and you will need to finish killing that part there. Again, not a progression blocker.
#####
##### - occasionally, when first loading into the game (on any map EXCEPT the Arms Race map,) the SandHawk
##### sniper rifle sometimes shows x8 projectiles while consuming 3 ammo per shot, instead of showing
##### x9 projectiles while consuming 1 ammo per shot and game needs to be reloaded to fix this. Best way to
##### avoid this is to load into Sanctuary DIRECTLY from main menu and then fast travel to Arms Race map...
#####
##### - Mr. Titan ALWAYS spawns in as "Raging Titan" and will immediately start fighting enemies near him.
##### So there are times where he will kill a weaker enemy for you. However, this is not a progression blocker. 
#####
##### - occasionally, Rachael the Anointed will float thru structures and land on top of them when spawning in
##### in the Plunderdome. However, this is not a progression blocker because thanks to the changed player
##### movement mechanics, it is easy to run up the wall and kill her so that the chest room still opens there.
#####
##### - Cartel Event enemies do not spawn in every session. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.
#####
##### - There have been changes made to the Vending Machine, in order for them to show much better loot.
##### I added statements that are specific to the Arms Race map and while they work for all machines on map,
##### for some reason, the Airdrop machines (and their itemoftheday) are the ONLY ones that are unaffected.
#####
##### - The Maliwan enemies that spawn during the Wotan fight are unaffected by the health buffs that I
##### implemented, even though the code works when fighting Wotan on the Maliwan Takedown map.
##### Not sure why it doesn't carry over to Arms Race map, however this is not a progression blocker.
#####
##### - occasionally, weapons will spawn with the "action skill end increase splash damage" anointment which
##### is useless on the Arms Race map. This was done intentionally due to the fact that if I did not include that
##### specific anointment, some weapons would spawn with no anointment at all even when I tried adding
##### extra statements for anointments to those weapons. One useless anointment is better than none at all...
#####
##### - the damage buff on the AAA seems to only affect the primary burst-fire mode
#####
##### - while self-damage is disabled, the child projectiles from a Backburner can still damage you
#####
##### - due to the Gunerang and Bangerang sharing a barrel, only the Gunerang is buffed properly
#####
##### - due to changes to the Bearcat, firing it continuously for a long time may lag the game a little bit
#####
##### - spamming elemental versions of the Surge grenade may lag the game a little bit
#####
##### - the damage buff on the Craps seems to only affect the Impact mode and has no affect on Sticky mode
#####
##### - the damage buff on the Ion Laser seems to only affect the Primary Firing Mode
#####
##### - the damage buff on the NightHawkin seems to have made the burst-fire mode display 0-burst,
##### instead of 4-burst which makes it full-auto even though the weapon says that it's burst-fire
#####
##### - the damage buff on the Ruby's Wrath seems to only really work right when the tracker is active
#####
##### - the damage buff on the S3RV-8OS-EXECUTE seems to only work right when spamming reloads
#####
##### - when doing a lvl 13 starter run, some of the passive percentages on some artifacts and class mods
##### show a NEGATIVE value and this is NOT a graphical glitch. Most artifacts are not suppose to be able
##### to drop below lvl 27, which is where their "baseline" starts, so gear at lower levels is impacted
##### negatively because of this but still drops since I had to make changes to level requirements
##### due to the necessity of having active health regeneration from the beginning of a run 
#####
#####
#####
##### The following is a list of featured named enemies (excluding dinos/spiderants/chubbies) currently in the mod:
#####
##### Lagromar, SpongeBoss BulletPants, Yellow Force Trooper, Caber Dowd, Anointed Alpha, Wotan the Invincible,
##### Gideon, Facemelter, One Punch, Xam, General Blisterpuss, Tink of Cunning, Skag of Survival, Aurelia, Shiv,

#####
#####
#####
##### This mod will continue to be updated for the foreseeable future... It will be based
##### on user-feedback and there are still a few things that I would like to add/change:
##### - more shield variety
##### - more artifact variety
##### - more grenade variety
##### - possibly more weapons, although I honestly think what's already here feels like is enough
##### - possibly more or altered/different custom loot pools
##### - would like to fix the airdrop machine and its itemoftheday to be like other vending machines
##### - would like to add more ammo machines on the map
